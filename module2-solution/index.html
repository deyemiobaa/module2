<p>In the next few sections I'll be creating sections and adding images and links to my page</p>
<p>Before we talk about how to create content, some questions prior to that needs to be answered and that’s WHY you are in business, HOW you go about providing that particular service or products, and WHAT they are. These three basic questions are basically all you need to create your content strategy as they help you identify who your audience/potential customers are and the best way to communicate with them. 
The first question, WHY are you in business? Simple, yet carries a lot of weight. Many business owners either fail to answer this question on time or they ignore it totally. They basically pay attention to WHAT they do or have to offer and that’s just reversing the process.
You may be wondering why this question is important and how does it relate to creating contents. Here’s how, a big part of creating contents for your brand is creating a compelling story that your audience can relate with. So the next question is how you know what story would resonate with your customers, well you can’t always know and the truth is it shouldn’t bother you so much. All you have to do go back to WHY you created your business, think about what you faced, the bridges you crossed before your idea became an ideal business, how you eventually provide these services and what the final results are. Creating contents around topics like this gives you one thing, authenticity and that’s something that’ll be unique to you, no other person or business can have the same story as you do. This story is what customers are concerned about, but this isn’t something they’ll tell you but it’s something they know you for. This might be hard to believe but people do business with you not because of what of you do or sell, there are other people who provide the same service or product as you do, they buy from you because of how doing business with you makes them feel, they are able to sense the passion you have for your business and this reflects in how you treat your customers.

	<h2>These is my first section body</h2>
	<p>This is my first section, I'm so happy to be writing html codes, it feels amazing check out my image below</p>
	<p>Listen to these two content variations created by two footwear businesses</p>
	<ol>
		<li>We make strong and durable shoes with quality materials at an affordable price. Walk like a king with when you wear our shoes. Shop with us today!</li>
		<li>We believe every step you take should command respect just like a king, that’s why we put together the best materials to produce our shoes. What’s more? The prices affordable! Shop with us today!</li>
	</ol>
	<p>And here’s something a lot of businesses fail to realize, giving out offers or price slashes might give you customers but they won’t give you loyal customers, if you build your business around bonuses and offers, customers who would do business with you are basically after those offers, and once you stop  these offers, they stop doing business with you. And to retain them again you have to build offers again and doing this continuously can hurt your business. Knowing your WHY not only gives you the right customers it gives you loyal customers</p>

	<p>Tips to creating content on twitter: Clarity, Discipline and Consistency</p>
	<p>Clarity: knowing what you want to talk about and presenting in the most concise way. You can create threads but make sure the first tweet in the thread sums up most of what you want to talk about, why? A lot of people might not have the time to go through your thread, you first tweet should give them and insight on the message you’re trying to pass and then create interest to read more.</p>
	<p>Discipline: Engaging in online arguments with your business account is just hurting your business, your next customer might be watching. You should avoid discussing about controversial topics with a business account.</p>
	<p>Consistency: Twitter algorithm shows up tweet to the audience based on several factors and rolling out consistent tweets will keep your tweet at the top of the feed</p>
